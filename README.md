## 📈 Projects

- **Email Generator using LangChain, Llama-3.1, and ChromaDB** - *(Aug 2024 - Sep 2024)*  
  Developed an intelligent email generator utilizing **LangChain** and **Llama-3.1-70b**, integrated with **ChromaDB** to analyze job descriptions. The system matches key skills and projects from my portfolio to generate personalized, professional job application emails.
  
- **Parallel Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for the Sequential Ordering Problem** - *(Jan 2024 - Present)*  
  Implemented multithreading techniques such as **work stealing**, **thread stopping**, and **dynamic load balancing** in **C++**. This optimization significantly reduced processing times, enhancing performance for solving the Sequential Ordering Problem.

- **Heart Disease Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - *(Oct 2023 - Nov 2023)*  
  Developed a machine learning model using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict heart disease. The project incorporated feature scaling, Z-score normalization, and outlier removal, optimizing accuracy through thorough data preprocessing and evaluation with **scikit-learn**.

- **Social Media Application on MERN** - *(Aug 2023 - Sep 2023)*  
  Built a full-stack social media platform, **Thread**, using the **MERN** stack. Designed and implemented both the front-end and back-end architecture for a seamless user experience.

- **Linux Task Manager and Keyboard Tracing** - *(Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)*  
  Developed a **GUI** using **tkinter** for real-time and historical performance visualization with advanced filtering options. Built a custom **keyboard interrupt handler** in **C++** for accurate real-time logging of keystrokes, achieving an accuracy rate of **99.5%**.
  
## 📚 Currently Learning
- Focused on my **Master's project**, which involves optimizing memory management for the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, alongside enhancing computational efficiency with advanced algorithmic techniques.
- Actively exploring **Machine Learning** and **AI** through multiple hands-on projects, with a particular interest in **Generative AI** and **advanced model optimization**.
